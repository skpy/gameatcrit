<h1>CRIT: The Community-Run Infinite Tabletop</h1>
<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<h3>BE KIND</h3>

<p>Wheaton's Law — “Don’t be a dick” — is a good starting point, but that's too vague and too passive for us at CRIT, the Community-Run Infinite Tabletop. Playful teasing from one person can cause real discomfort in another, putting the onus on the uncomfortable person to say “stop” and creating potential conflict. Not being a jerk is not the same as offering proactive support to someone receiving disrespect or abuse.</p>

<p>We're asking you to be kind and intentionally supportive of your fellow participants: GMs, players, event organizers, and anyone else involved in CRIT.</p>

<p>We are here to have a good time. Most folks are friendly and good-natured. Disagreements and misunderstandings will happen, so we encourage everyone to work together toward satisfying resolutions with patience, openness, respect, and understanding.</p>

<p>Kindness is the solution as well as its own reward.</p>

<h3>FOR PLAYERS</he3>
<p>Bring your highest level of contagious enthusiasm! Root for the other players in the game. Share the spotlight, praise your peers’ creativity, and keep each other safe.</p>
<p>You are part of a team. No one’s fun should come at the expense of another’s. Work together with camaraderie, and appreciate your shared love of the role-playing hobby. “No” means no, and "stop” means stop; if the GM or a fellow player asks you to stop something, you are expected to honor that request.</p>
<p>Support your GM. GM rulings are final. We’re here to play, not to argue. Outside of the briefest appeals, please abide in the moment and discuss rulings and situations after the session, when it won’t take table time away from your fellow players. It’s only a game. If you have a problem with another player, please notify your GM immediately.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with your GM, notify the organizers via Discord or at <a href="mailto:gameatcrit@gmail.com">gameatcrit@gmail.com</a> ASAP.</p>
<p>We will do everything we can to deal with any unpleasant situations arising during our open online event, but your primary obligation is to take care of yourself. No game is worth your safety or your comfort. While we don’t want anyone to leave a game because of someone else's bad behavior, simply excusing yourself from an unpleasant situation is always a valid option. There will be future games with better people.</p>

<h3>FOR GAME MASTERS</h3>
<p>You are the role model for your table. You set the tone and the energy. You are not the players’ adversary. You are the facilitator of the game.

<p>As a starting point, study Runehammer’s Game Master’s Oath (ICRPG Master Ed., pp. 77-78): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNxncUQlTjE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNxncUQlTjE</a></p>

<p>All games are expected to approximate the MPAA’s PG-13 in terms of narrative content. Coarse language is generally okay, while overt sexuality and intensely graphic descriptions of violence will be more strictly governed. Be willing to check in with your players, and respect their limits.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to discuss and identify any potentially uncomfortable themes or subject matter players may encounter in your game ahead of your session (in group chat or in private), so that players are not surprised by your content. Contacting your players as they sign
up for your session to solicit any specific concerns is a valid practice.</p>

<p>Open every game with a round of brief introductions and a review of general game content. As the host of the game, you have an obligation to make an effort to ensure every player's comfort. Please review and consider the safety tools in these online RPG safety toolkits:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ttrpgsafetytoolkit.com/">https://ttrpgsafetytoolkit.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.anneloverso.com/rpg-safety-tools">https://www.anneloverso.com/rpg-safety-tools</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>If a player reports a problem with another player, please take such comments seriously. Pause the game, and see what's going on. If someone is being unkind or causing problems, you have permission to eject that player from your game.</p>
<p>If a player causes intentional grief, be prepared to duplicate your game and distribute a new game URL to the remaining players, excluding the offender.</p>

<h3>FOR EVENT ORGANIZERS</h3>
<p>We are obliged to create a supportive and welcoming environment. We understand that people have different sensibilities, and we will work to ensure that all games have a reasonable explanation of expected content, so that players can select games that interest them and avoid games they might not enjoy. We will do our best to reduce the friction caused by disagreements, misunderstandings, and conflict among groups of strangers coming together with different assumptions and expectations. Reports of problems will be handled promptly, with calmness and respect demonstrated toward all concerned parties, avoiding premature conclusions and gathering as much information as we can. We will discuss together how best to respond, if response becomes necessary, and we will work to incorporate lessons learned into future events held under the CRIT banner.</p>
